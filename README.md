# ðŸŽ¼ Digital Melodies: Crafting Music from Binary Code ðŸŽ¶

Welcome to **Digital Melodies**! This project transforms binaries into captivating music.

## What's This All About?

At its core, this project explores the intriguing concept of utilizing the distinctive patterns found in binaries to create music. We take binary data, decipher its bytes, and translate them into musical notes.

## How It Works

1. **Read the Binary**: We initiate by extracting the bytes from a binary file.
2. **Map to Musical Notes**: Each byte is then meticulously assigned to a musical note within our range spanning from C0 to B8.
3. **Compose the Tune**: These mapped notes are artfully sequenced, resulting in an original piece of music inspired by the structure of the binary data.
4. **Play It Loud (or Soft)**: Finally, our script orchestrates these notes, bringing the data to life through captivating melodies!

## Developed Using:

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/jvang0620/Digital-Melodies</code></pre>

2. Install necessarity packages:

   `python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip`

   - This command invokes Python (python.exe) and instructs it to run the pip module with the install subcommand.
   - The --upgrade option tells pip to upgrade the specified package if it's already installed.
   - The package name specified here is pip itself, so this command upgrades the pip package to the latest version.

   `python -m pip install pydub`

   - This command invokes Python and instructs it to run the pip module with the install subcommand.
   - It installs the pydub package, which is a Python library for working with audio files.

   `python -m pip install simpleaudio`

   - Similar to the previous command, this installs the simpleaudio package, which is another Python library used for playing and recording audio.

In summary, these commands ensure that you have the necessary Python packages (pip, pydub, and simpleaudio) installed in your Python environment.

4. Add any .mp3 files into folder within the root directory (mine is call `media`)
   <br />

5. Run application:

   - In the directory where your python file and .mp3s are located, type into the terminal:

     `python data_melodies_maker.py NAMEOFMP3FILEHERE.mp3`

    <br />

   - Terminal will display something like this (\*Note: Processing time increases with the duration of the .mp3 file):
