# ðŸŽ¼ Digital Melodies: Crafting Music from Binary Code ðŸŽ¶

Welcome to **Digital Melodies**! This project transforms binaries into captivating music.

## What's This All About?

At its core, this project explores the intriguing concept of utilizing the distinctive patterns found in binaries to create music. We take binary data, decipher its bytes, and translate them into musical notes.

## How It Works

1. **Read the Binary**: We initiate by extracting the bytes from a binary file.
2. **Map to Musical Notes**: Each byte is then meticulously assigned to a musical note within our range spanning from C0 to B8.
3. **Compose the Tune**: These mapped notes are artfully sequenced, resulting in an original piece of music inspired by the structure of the binary data.
4. **Play It Loud (or Soft)**: Finally, our script orchestrates these notes, bringing the data to life through captivating melodies!
